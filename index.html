		<p>Hello! My name is Will Lance and I'm a freshman at <em>NC State University</em>. My plan is to recieve a bachelor's degree in <strong>Aerospace Engineering</strong> while in college. One of my favorite things is to work with complex machines that involve many mechanical and electrical parts in them. This, combined with my interest in physics and rocketry, made me want to pursue engineering in the aerospace field. Currently I'm a part of the <em>Tacho Lycos Club</em>, otherwise known as rocketry club, which involves many hands-on projects and a good opportunity to practice my engineering skills!
		</p>
		<br />
		
		<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px; color:#674ea7; text-align:right">My dream career would have to be an engineer who specializes in designing and building complex mechanical parts for spacecraft like the <ins>SLS rocket</ins> or the <ins>Mars rover</ins>. Of course a momumental task like building rockets would require a team of engineers with extensive knowledge in <em>many</em> different fields. Eventually, I plan on trying for an internship with a large company that manufacters large, complex parts for projects like rockets. Examples of companies like these would be <em>Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, Boeing</em>, or even an organization like <em>NASA</em>.
