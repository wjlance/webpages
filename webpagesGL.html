		<p>Hey my name's Will Lance, and I'm a freshman at NC State University.
		I've lived in Hendersonville, NC for most of my life but my family moved from Severville, TN when I was 3. 
		I'm planning on getting a Bachelor's Degree in engineering, but I'm not sure which major yet.
		My favorite activites are playing video games, playing bass, and rock climbing.
